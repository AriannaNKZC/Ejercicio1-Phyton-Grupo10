1bwbuka,liovg3d,"Why have Republicans become so weird and horrible?

Republicans complain about voter fraud and stolen elections but then try to do voter fraud and steal elections. Christians back Trump despite him being a horrible and immoral person. Conservatives back him despite him massively raising the deficit. Military people back him despite him saying soldiers who die are losers. Republicans as a whole seem to have given up on fair elections and democracy despite invading the Middle East 20 years ago to ""spread democracy"".

And that's without mentioning all the alternative facts, denialism, conspiracy theories, lies, misinformation etc that they're constantly putting out and believing. Don't get me started on flat earthers.

Why has half the US gone absolutely bonkers in the last couple of decades? How can they be so willing to throw all their values under the bus? Why do they get upset at democrats/progressives doing literally anything? Make it make sense. üò≠",22,1723971108.0
1bwbuka,lrr3s01,"40 members of Trump's cabinet have openly stated that Donald Trump is unfit to be President and a danger to our country, including his own Vice President. His supporters don't care. 

MAGA is largely a white grievance movement. It's an emotional response to changing demographics in this country and a perceived loss of privilege. That emotional response will not be swayed by objective facts. 

The truly scary people are the cynical and power hungry figures like JD Vance and Speaker Mike Johnson who know exactly who and what Donald Trump is, and pretend to support him and his goals, as a useful avenue to enacting their own agenda.",21,1728842158.0
1bwbuka,lrqxcmj,"Why are Trump supporters ignoring all of the warnings from our country's most senior and respected leaders? They don't seem to take this seriously. In Bob Woodward's new book, General Mark Milley called Trump ""fascist to the core"" and a threat to our country. Are Trump supporters not seeing this stuff, or just ignoring it? Because it seems to me that if Americans could trust anyone, they'd trust Trump's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",17,1728840159.0
1bwbuka,kz71v03,"Ron Paul was polling around 18% at this point in 2012.¬†¬†


It's an inescapable fact that people answer opinion polls differently than they do actual election polls.¬† People aren't paying attention to the pollster, or want to express displeasure with their candidate, or they're intentionally giving wrong answers.¬† That's why it's better to just completely ignore 3-way polls.¬†¬†",14,1712901651.0
1bwbuka,liwm9ok,"Here's an article that talks about the related history; it's not new, this faction has long been around, and there was a notable intraparty dispute back in the 1950s/60s with the John Birch society and the same kind of right-wing craziness, and i'm sure the history goes back further as wlel.

note that while that source is pretty left, I'm sure you could find a more neutral source which verifies many of the broad strokes of the history.
